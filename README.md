The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) 
 Assignment I
 Submission Deadline – 21 February 2025 
Comparative Analysis of ML, DL and SNN Algorithms in AIoT Applications
Objective: The goal of this assignment is to implement and compare the performance of various machine 
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, including a spiking neural network (SNN), in the context of 
an Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) application. By using a dataset consisting of images of cats and dogs
(or a dataset of your choice), you will gain a comprehensive understanding of supervised and unsupervised 
learning techniques and their applications in AIoT environments.
Relation to AIoT: This assignment is closely related to AIoT as it showcases how machine learning and deep 
learning models can be integrated into intelligent systems that process visual data from connected devices. In 
AIoT, devices such as cameras, sensors, and other smart devices generate vast amounts of data. The ability to 
classify and analyze this data in real-time using advanced algorithms, such as CNNs and SNNs, exemplifies the 
intersection of AI and IoT technologies. By applying these models to image data, the assignment demonstrates 
how intelligent decision-making can be achieved in AIoT applications, leading to improved automation, 
efficiency, and user experiences in smart environments.
Data Collection: Utilize a dataset containing images of cats and dogs (or a dataset of your choice). 
Algorithms: You should implement 5 algorithms of your choice, selecting one from each category and using 
the same dataset for all algorithms: Supervised ML Algorithm, Unsupervised ML Algorithm, Supervised DL 
Algorithm, Unsupervised DL Algorithm, Spiking Neural 代 写COMP4436、Python
代做程序编程语言Network (SNN)
Evaluation Metrics: Algorithms should be compared based on various metrics, including but not limited to:
Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified instances, Precision: Ratio of true positives to the total predicted 
positives, Recall: Ratio of true positives to the total actual positives, F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision 
and recall, Runtime Efficiency: Time taken for each algorithm to complete the training and evaluation process.
Visualization: Generate comparative graphs and tables to present results, facilitating easier analysis of the 
performance of each algorithm. This will include plots of accuracy across different algorithms.
Expected Outcome: The assignment will culminate in a comprehensive report featuring detailed graphs and 
tables comparing the results of all implemented algorithms. This report will highlight the superior performance 
of the spiking neural network in classifying images of cats and dogs, demonstrating its potential advantages in 
AIoT applications.
Submission: Please use the attached report template as a reference. The report should be 6-8 pages long, 
formatted in two columns, and include elements such as graphs, flowcharts, equations, tables, and references. 
Ensure that all source code files, datasets, and relevant materials are uploaded to Blackboard. Your Python code 
should be compatible with VS Code and include a README file that explains how to execute the code.
BONUS Points: 2.0 points awarded if you achieve an SNN accuracy of over 85% with correct implementation
and 0.25 points awarded if you propose a unique title for your report. ZERO points will be assigned if any 
evidence of copying is discovered, regardless of an appeal.
